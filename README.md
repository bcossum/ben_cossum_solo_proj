# board_game_tracker

An application I designed to help users track plays of board games. The application links to an online board game database by using the boardgamegeek.com API. To find games 
users use a search bar that pulls from the Board Game Geek database and populates a list of clickable links to individual board game pages. Once on a game's page users can 
add the game to favorites or log plays that can include any number of players and records individual victory points and who of the players won the game. Recently played 
games are displayed on each user's home page as clickable images that will take them to a summary of that play.
